ExternalScanController
======================

## Idea

Idea was to fill a TextField with content from an external barcode scanner (over bluetooth HID profile). 
The class shows an option for such an implementation.


## Include

* Add .h and .m file to the project
* Add ExternalScanControllerDelegate 
* Implement didScanContent: method

See the example project for a better understanding.
